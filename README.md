### What is this? 
This is a reference enviroment for the manuscript "A thermodynamic framework for modelling membrane transporters". Running the code in this environment will reproduce the figures in the manuscript.

### How do I use it?
In order to use the reference enviroment, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) need to be installed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/transporter_thermodynamics_reference_environment.git
$ cd transporter_thermodynamics_reference_environment
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant reload
```
